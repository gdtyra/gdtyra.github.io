<p>Note, when I say "root" below, I mean Proto-Indo-European root, and even then I'm simplifying it just to get a general sense. Same simplification goes for references to Old English where I'm not using the proper Old English letters like Thorn because they're not on my keyboard. The point is just to broadly understand how common words we take for granted are connected to the past and to other languages, not to be academic about it.</p>

<h2 id="function-words">Function words</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code>/<code>an</code>: original form was "an" from Old English, meaning "one" or "single". Same root "oi-no-" as "one" and "unique".</li>
<li><code>the</code>/<code>that</code>/<code>this</code>: from Old English and related to roots "to-/te-", "so-/se-", and "-s/-es". "This" emphasizes nearness.</li>

<li><code>what</code>/<code>who</code>/<code>why</code>/<code>where</code>/<code>when</code>/<code>how</code>: originally from words starting with a "k" sound, hence why Latin and Spanish equivalents start with "q".</li>
<li><code>and</code>: from roots "en/eti", meaning "in addition" or "also".</li>
<li><code>but</code>: from Old English "butan", derived from "be" and "utan", meaning "outside", so "be outside". Related to root "ud-" meaning "up" or "out" and Latin "ut". First spacial, then logical.</li>
